## Overview
This project is an expansion of a **solar system application**. The project features a **3D interactive space environment** where a spaceship navigates through space, collects fuel, and avoids obstacles.

It is built using **Visual Studio** with possible usage of **C++ and OpenGL** for rendering.

## **Project Features**
- ðŸš€ **3rd Person Camera**: A spaceship is positioned in front of the camera and moves with it.
- ðŸŒŒ **Skybox**: A surrounding deep-space skybox enhances the realism of the scene.
- â›½ **Fuel Collection**: Random floating fuel tanks are available in space, and the spaceship must collect them.
- ðŸŽ® **Game Over Mechanic**: If the spaceship runs out of fuel, the game ends, and the time spent flying is displayed as the score.
- ðŸ’¥ **Bonus Feature**: Random flying debris exists in space. If the spaceship collides with debris, it explodes, and the game is over.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- OpenGL / GLUT (if applicable)
- Visual Studio
- 3D modeling for spaceships and skybox

---

## **Installation and Setup**
### **Prerequisites**
- Install **Visual Studio (Version 16 or later)**
- Ensure **C++ development tools** are installed
- (If applicable) Install **OpenGL**, **GLUT**, or any required 3D graphics libraries

## How to Play
- Run the compiled application.
- Use the provided controls to navigate the spaceship.
- Collect fuel tanks to stay in the game.
- Avoid collisions with debris.
- The game ends when fuel runs out or a collision occurs.
